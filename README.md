# SAG-MODEA-MFAR

This is a portion of the example code from the paper. The paper features eight scenarios, and here we display all the experiments for the first scenario, including the complete code for the proposed algorithm MOEAD-MFAR and the comparative experimental algorithms MOEA/D-MFAR-nr, MODA/D, MOPSO, and NSGAII as applied to the first scenario. The code for other scenarios can be obtained by modifying the parameters within the code.
