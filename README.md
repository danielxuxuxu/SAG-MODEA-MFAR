# SAG-MODEA-MFAR

This is a section of example code from the paper. The paper includes eight scenarios, and here we present all the experiments for the first scenario, including the complete code for the proposed algorithm MOEAD-MFAR and the comparative experimental algorithms MOEAD-MFAR-nr, MODA/D, MOPSO, and NSGAII as applied in the first scenario.
